This repository contains two machine learning projects I have worked on.
1. A flask app that detects the presence of abusive language in text. Link to heroku app: https://dabl.herokuapp.com/
2. An experiment that uses environmental sensor data to predict the location of the user from one of three categories: subway, near the ocean (or river), and in city traffic. 

WARNING: Some of the text data in the Jupyter Notebook file and the CSV files for the Abusive Language project contain uncensored offensive language.
