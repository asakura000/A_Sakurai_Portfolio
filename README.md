This repository contains two machine learning projects I have worked on.
1. A flask app that detects the presence of abusive language in text. 

The dataset for this project came from here: https://www.kaggle.com/usharengaraju/dynamically-generated-hate-speech-dataset
And is based on a paper linked here: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0243300, which cites a collection of hate speech data listed here: https://hatespeechdata.com/

2. An experiment that uses environmental sensor data to predict the location of the user from one of three categories: subway, near the ocean (or river), and in city traffic. 

3. Link to another repository that is a relation extraction web application: https://github.com/asakura000/rel_ext_proto_1

WARNING: Some of the text data in the Jupyter Notebook file and the CSV files for the Abusive Language project contain uncensored offensive language.
